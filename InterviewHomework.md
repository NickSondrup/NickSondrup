 # Interview Homework
 
 **Preparing for the big interview**
 
 I know myself and my nerves so I need to start preparing for the interview the night before. I have to make sure I have a nice calm night so I can get a good nights rest and not keep myself up worring about it all night. In order to do that I need to make sure I have done my research on the company and written down a practice elevator pitch a few days before so I can have practiced early and can rest easy the night before. The day of but before the interview I plan on making sure i've eaten well but not too much and can review my elevator pitch and look over any notes i've created relating to that company.  
 
 **Elevator Pitch**
 
 Nice to meet you! I grew up around here and am a passionate software developer. I have a passion for building things and watching my creations grow. When I was young I would blow my parents away by building elaborate structures with legos and as I grew older I found a love for building and painting models. I started my work experience with several customer service jobs at RC Willey and Albertsons where I became a master of orginzation and helped train people. Since then I Attended Codeworks and found a real love for software development. Development fit into my love of building and creating in a surprising fashion. I genuinely enjoy watching each piece of an application fall into place and being able to step back time to time and see how much it has changed. I find myself excited to build each new application and think this love of building will be a great fit for your team. 

**White board challenge experience:**

Talan and I practiced white board challenges. He had to do the "Fizz Buzz" challenge and the "Bang" challenge. I had done the fizz buzz one before and was able to walk him through my logic very easily with that one but the bang one threw me for a loop for a minute, but i remembered what people and said and vocalized my thoughts through the whole project and was able to get the answer eventually. Next time i think I could. 

**STAR Questions**

Situation:

Task:

Action:

Resolution:

1. Talk about a time when you had to work closely with someone whose personality was very different from yours.

When I was working at Albertsons I often worked with people with a bit less drive than myself. This one kid in particular was really struggling to stay focused and get his work done. Rather than "tattling" on him or getting frustrated with him I realized he would work incredibly fast when told he could leave early once all his work was done. I brought this up to my superiors and they allowed us to use this ulimatum with him. It resulted in his work getting done on time and he still often had to stay his whole shift in order to finish.

2. Tell me about a time when you made sure a customer was pleased with your service.

This was always been my specialty in my customer service experience. I am very kind and caring and often went out of my way to make sure the customer got the best service possible. At Albertsons I had an old lady who would call and ask for me specifically to check on the organic lettuce and pick out a good one for her. She was often grumpy and irritable with my coworkers but would always compliment me on being so kind and motivated. 

3. Tell me about the first job you’ve ever had. What did you do to learn the ropes?

My first job was at RC Willey in the warehouse. I started there just before I got out of high school and found myself unwelcome with many of my coworkers because to them I was the young kid that only got the job because I was friends with the manager's son. I realized I needed to prove myself to these guys and not only show that I could carry my weight but that I could go the extra mile. I took it on myself to learn as many different positions as possible was always up to help with any task. I soon found myself friends with most the crew and would help every deparment from stocking with lifts to going out for deliveries when needed. 


4. Describe a long-term project that you managed. How did you keep everything moving along in a timely manner?

During my time at Codeworks we created a two week Capstone project and I found myself voted as the project manager. We were tasked with building a full stack application using technologies like Vue and Node. In order to keep the application moving I made sure to immediately handle any dipute right away and made sure we all had a solid understanding of each part of the application. We created a large and complex application that hosts over 350,000 video games, works great and looks amazing.

5. Tell me about a time when you worked under close supervision or extremely loose supervision. How did you handle that?

I worked for a year as a Valet in Salt Lake City parking cars for restaurants and hotels. We were almost always left unsupervised for the shift and would have to clock in remotely from a cellphone. Being left alone and responsible for the safety of the cars I've parked I was always alert and ready for the next client. My managers recognized my drive, moved me to shift supervisor quickly and were sad when I had to move back to Boise.
