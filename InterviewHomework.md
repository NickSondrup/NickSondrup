  Nice to meet you! I grew up around here and am a passionate software developer. I have a passion for building things and watching my creations grow. When I was young I would blow my parents away by building elaborate structures with legos and as I grew older I found a passion for building and painting models. I started my work experience with several customer service jobs at RC Willey and Albertsons where I became a master of orginzation and helped train people. Since then I Attended Codeworks and found a real love for software development. Development fit into my love of building and creating in a surprising fashion. I genuinely enjoy watching each piece of an application fall into place and being able to step back time to time and see how much it has changed. I find myself excited to build each new application and think this love of building will be a great fit for your team.
