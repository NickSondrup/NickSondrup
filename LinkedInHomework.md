**Message Roughdraft**

Hello (insert name here)!

My name is Nick Sondrup and I'm trying to connect with like minded individuals in a hope to find a team I think I can help out and will be a good fit for. I've noticed you have (insert software development skill/experience here) listed in your profile. I have some experience with (said skill/experience) and I was wondering if I could ask you a few question about the methods you find most effect. Thank you for your time and I look forward to connecting with you. 

Nicks Notes: My thought with this message is making it amorphous (like our coding) so that it can be used in many situations with only minor changes.
